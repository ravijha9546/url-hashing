# Assumptions Made

1. **DynamoDB Table Exists**: It is assumed that the DynamoDB table (specified in the `USERS_TABLE` environment variable) has been created before deploying the application.

2. **URL Format**: It is assumed that the input URLs provided to the service are in a valid format. The service does not perform extensive validation on the URL format.

3. **Single Use**: The current implementation allows for single use or limited use of URLs, meaning that once a URL has been accessed a specified number of times, it may no longer be available.

4. **AWS Permissions**: It is assumed that the Lambda function has been granted appropriate permissions to perform operations on DynamoDB (e.g., `PutItem`, `GetItem`, `UpdateItem`).

5. **Serverless Framework**: The project assumes familiarity with the Serverless Framework for deployment and management of AWS Lambda functions.

6. **Development Environment**: It is assumed that developers have Node.js and npm installed on their local machines for running and testing the application.
